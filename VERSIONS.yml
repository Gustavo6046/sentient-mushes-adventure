            "traps":
                name: "Trap System"
                description: "Traps would be layed down by human players. Living entities (Creatures) that lie in the same place as traps have a     chance to be damaged or even killed."
                notes:
                    - "Container Traps prevent smaller entities from moving for a set amount of turns. Example: arapuca, rope trap."
                    - "Simple Traps damage smaller entities and are destroyed easily by large entities. Example: rabbit snare."
                    - "Blunt Traps deal a bit less damage, but are reusable and require 2 turns for a larger creature to be able to destroy them. Example: pebble fall trap."
                    - "Sturdy Traps deal a decent damage, and can be used a set number of times. Can not be destroyed without a mush or human creature to disarm. Example: bear trap."
                    - "Lethal Traps are one-use, so they are destroyed when they are used, but can kill small entities and severely damage larger entities. Example: landmine."
                    
            "breeding":
                name: "Creature Breeding"
                description: "A slightly nasty, but nonetheless accurate way to avoid lack of fauna ingame. It can be made less nasty in a couple ways."
                notes:
                    - "Creatures have two variables: willTimer and gestationTimer. Once willTimer is set to 0, there is a     chance the humor of two creatures of the same entity type is raised significantly, and if gestationTimer < 2 (when it reaches 0 it is set back to its original value), there is a good     chance one of the entities will become pregnant."
